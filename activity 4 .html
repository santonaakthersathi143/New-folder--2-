    There are 10 classrooms on each floor. All the classrooms are big and airy. There is a well-equipped laboratory too. My
    school has a big library. There are many storybooks, magazines and newspapers in the library.
    
    My school has a big playground. It is always Clean. There are many trees around the ground. There are one thousand
    students and sixty teachers in my school. All the teachers are well-qualified and experienced. They teach us very well.
    Mr. Sharma is our principal. He is very strict. He wants us to be disciplined and punctual. There are five clerks, four
    peons, a lab assistant and a lab attendant in our school.
    
    The peons keep the school neat and clean. The sanitation of our school is quite satisfactory. We have a sufficient
    supply of fresh water. The school arranges cultural activities like sports, drawing, songs, dramas, debates, dances,
    etc. every year. I love my school very much.</blockquote>
